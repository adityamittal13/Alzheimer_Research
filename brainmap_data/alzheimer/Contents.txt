This archive contains expression data for rows 1 through 40 of a 'search' search
at a 'Coarse' resolution level, arranged by donors,structures.

The file Expression.csv contains expression values, calculated using zscore normalization.
Each row begins with the ID of a probe.

The file Columns.csv contains metadata for each column in Expression.csv, arranged in the same order.
The columns sample_mri_0, sample_mri_1, sample_mri_2 should be understood to be MRI coordinates of the sample in x,y,z order.
A value of -1 in any of the sample_xxx columns of Columns.csv indicates that there is no sample data for that column.
This can occur for example when there are multiple donors in the data set, and not all structures have been sampled in all donors.
Corresponding cells in Expression.csv will be blank.

The file Probes.csv contains metadata for the probes referenced in Expression.csv.

The original search can be reproduced on our web site at https://human.brain-map.org/microarray/search/show?search_term=91&search_type=gene_classification&page_num=0
